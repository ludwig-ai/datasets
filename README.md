# Motivation
Open Source Datasets to Use for Demonstrating Ludwig Capabilities

# Background

These datasets are obtained from public sources, such as Kaggle, HuggingFace, and individual GitHub repositories.  In certain situations, this repository contains conditioned (e.g., cleaned) versions of the corresponding original datasets.

# Usage Pattern

For example, the dataset can now be accessed as "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludwig-ai/datasets/main/TLDRNews/tldr_news_full.csv.gz" and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using:
```
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df_dataset: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludwig-ai/datasets/main/TLDRNews/tldr_news_full.csv.gz", compression="gzip")
>>> df_dataset.shape
(7932, 4)
>>> df_dataset.head(n=5)
   split                                           headline                                            content  category

Hence, it will no longer be necessary to upload datasets into Google Drive and mount the drive in Colab notebooks.
